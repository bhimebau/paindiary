		======File-level Analysis Summary======


extern void flash_erase_page() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 42 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	__enable_interrupt() (1 times)
	__disable_interrupt() (1 times)

    It appears to be inlineable (size = 28 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	__enable_interrupt() (1 times)
	__disable_interrupt() (1 times)


These functions may be recursive:
	flash_erase_page()
	flash_write()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	__disable_interrupt()
	__enable_interrupt()
